# BLUETOOTH CONTROLLED ROBOT USING MSP-EXP430G2 WITH PROPORTIONAL SPEED CONTROL
MSP-EXP430G2 is a launchpad development kit that can be used in various applications. A
bluetooth controlled robot is one such example that allows the user to control a robot remotely
using a bluetooth device. The aim of this project is to design and implement a 2 wheeled
locomotion robot controlled using Bluetooth module with proportional speed control.
